XML-demo
========

This is a demonstration of the programmatic generation of XML presented to the UMD Libraries' Emerging Technologies Discussion Group (ETDG) on May 20, 2014. The script in [phonedir.py](phonedir.py) takes the tab-delimited phone directory data from [input.txt](input.txt), parses it, and generates an XML tree for the directory using the lxml.etree module ([lxml.de](http://lxml.de)). An example of the output is saved as [output.xml](output.xml).
